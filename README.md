# core-imaging-playground
This is just me playing around with .NET imaging libraries.

NOTE: FreeImage requires the Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package to run on Windows. You can find a link to the latest supported version [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
